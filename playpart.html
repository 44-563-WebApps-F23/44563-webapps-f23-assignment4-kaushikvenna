<p>BRACK.

    H'm--how stupid of me not to have thought of that!
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    [Turning her head to look at him.] Why stupid?
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little--earlier.
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    [Crossing the room.] Then you would have found no one to receive you;
    for I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley
    through?
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    You have forgotten to arrange one.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    That was another piece of stupidity.
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    Well, we must just settle down here--and wait. Tesman is not likely to
    be back for some time yet.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    Never mind; I shall not be impatient.
    
    
      HEDDA seats herself in the corner of the sofa.  BRACK lays his
      overcoat over the back of the nearest chair, and sits down, but
      keeps his hat in his hand.  A short silence.  They look at each
      other.
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    Well?
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    [In the same tone.] Well?
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    I spoke first.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    [Bending a little forward.] Come, let us have a cosy little chat, Mrs.
    Hedda.(8)
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    [Leaning further back in the sofa.] Does it not seem like a whole
    eternity since our last talk? Of course I don't count those few words
    yesterday evening and this morning.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    You mean since our last confidential talk? Our last _tete-a-tete_?
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    Well yes--since you put it so.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    Not a day passed but I have wished that you were home again.
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    And I have done nothing but wish the same thing.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    You? Really, Mrs. Hedda? And I thought you had been enjoying your tour
    so much!
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    Oh yes, you may be sure of that!
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    But Tesman's letters spoke of nothing but happiness.
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    Oh, Tesman! You see, he thinks nothing is so delightful as grubbing
    in libraries and making copies of old parchments, or whatever you call
    them.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    [With a smile of malice.] Well, that is his vocation in life--or part of
    it at any rate.
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    Yes, of course; and no doubt when it's your vocation--. But _I_! Oh, my
    dear Mr. Brack, how mortally bored I have been.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    [Sympathetically.] Do you really say so? In downright earnest?
