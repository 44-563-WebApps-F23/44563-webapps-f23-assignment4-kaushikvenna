<h1>Kaushik Ram Koteshwar Venna acts in a play</h1>

<p>HEDDA.

    Come in then, Judge.
    
    
      JUDGE BRACK, dressed as though for a men's party, enters by
      the glass door.  He carries a light overcoat over his arm.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    What the deuce--haven't you tired of that sport, yet? What are you
    shooting at?
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    Oh, I am only firing in the air.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    [Gently takes the pistol out of her hand.] Allow me, madam! [Looks at
    it.] Ah--I know this pistol well! [Looks around.] Where is the case? Ah,
    here it is. [Lays the pistol in it, and shuts it.] Now we won't play at
    that game any more to-day.
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    Then what in heaven's name would you have me do with myself?
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    Have you had no visitors?
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    [Closing the glass door.] Not one. I suppose all our set are still out
    of town.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    And is Tesman not at home either?
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    [At the writing-table, putting the pistol-case in a drawer which she
    shuts.] No. He rushed off to his aunt's directly after lunch; he didn't
    expect you so early.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    H'm--how stupid of me not to have thought of that!
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    [Turning her head to look at him.] Why stupid?
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little--earlier.
    
    
    HEDDA.
    
    [Crossing the room.] Then you would have found no one to receive you;
    for I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.
    
    
    BRACK.
    
    And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley
    through?
